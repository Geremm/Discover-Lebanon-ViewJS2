Others believe the formation is tied to ancient Phoenician rituals or maritime folklore.

With two main mountain ranges—the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains—running parallel to the coast, hikers are spoiled with stunning panoramic views, fresh mountain air, and diverse ecosystems. Trails range from easy scenic walks to challenging treks reaching altitudes above 2,500 meters. Some of the most popular destinations include the Qadisha Valley, a deep gorge carved into the mountains, home to ancient Christian monasteries built into the cliffs; the Tannourine Cedar Forest Reserve, where trails wind through centuries-old cedar trees and limestone formations; and the Chouf Biosphere Reserve, Lebanon's largest protected area, where you can hike for hours across forests, meadows, and villages. Hiking in Lebanon isn't just about the physical activity—it's also a cultural experience. You pass through traditional mountain villages, encounter shepherds and farmers, and enjoy homemade food in local guesthouses. The unique geography of Lebanon allows you to see the Mediterranean Sea from mountain peaks, making every hike feel surreal. Whether you're watching the sun rise from the summit of Mount Sannine or exploring snow-covered trails in winter, mountain hiking in Lebanon is a journey into the heart of nature and heritage.", // Texte complet de hiking.html

Stretching over 200 kilometers from Naqoura in the south to Akkar in the north, the Lebanese coast is dotted with sandy beaches, rocky coves, and vibrant beach clubs. One of the most iconic beach destinations is Batroun, a charming coastal town famous for its natural sea wall, clear blue waters, and lively beach bars. Byblos (Jbeil) offers a perfect mix of history and relaxation, where you can sunbathe by the sea just steps away from ancient Phoenician ruins. Tyre (Sour) in the south is home to some of the country's most pristine public beaches, with wide stretches of golden sand and calm, shallow waters ideal for families. In Jiyyeh and Rmeileh, you'll find luxurious resorts alongside more rustic, natural spots perfect for a quiet retreat. What makes Lebanon's beach scene so special is the diversity: you can enjoy a party atmosphere with DJs and cocktails, or a tranquil moment watching the sunset with your feet in the sand. The warm Mediterranean climate ensures a long beach season, and the proximity of sea and mountains means you can swim in the morning and hike in the afternoon.

The country's diverse geology, especially its abundant limestone formations, has given rise to a wide array of caves, some easily accessible and others reserved for more experienced adventurers. Jeita Grotto, Lebanon's most famous cave system, is a national treasure and a must-see destination. Divided into upper and lower galleries, it features colossal stalactites and stalagmites, shimmering underground lakes, and cathedral-like chambers carved by nature over millions of years. Beyond Jeita, Lebanon hosts a variety of lesser-known caves waiting to be explored. Afqa Cave, the legendary source of the Adonis River, combines mythology and nature in a dramatic cliffside setting. Roueiss Cave in the Baatara region leads to the famous Baatara Gorge Waterfall, a surreal site where a river falls through a triple natural bridge into a deep sinkhole. Caving in Lebanon is not just about sightseeing—it's a thrilling exploration that connects you to the geological forces that shaped the land. Some caves require rappelling, crawling, and navigating narrow passages, making them perfect for adrenaline-seekers and spelunking enthusiasts. Others are family-friendly and include guided tours with lighting and walkways.

In the Chouf Cedar Reserve, campers can sleep beneath majestic cedar trees, surrounded by wildlife and the cool breeze of the highlands. Sites like Tannourine and Laqlouq offer breathtaking views, clean air, and the opportunity to stargaze far from the city lights. For a more adventurous experience, you can camp along hiking trails or at the edge of dramatic cliffs overlooking the Qadisha Valley. In contrast, coastal camping spots in Chekka, Rmeileh, or Anfeh allow you to sleep to the sound of waves and wake up to sunrise over the sea. Many campgrounds in Lebanon now offer eco-friendly amenities, including wooden cabins, bonfire areas, and shared kitchens, making camping accessible even for first-timers. What truly sets camping in Lebanon apart is the sense of community and hospitality. Locals often invite campers to share meals, tell stories around the fire, or guide them through nearby villages and trails.

For mountain biking enthusiasts, trails in the Chouf Biosphere Reserve, Qadisha Valley, or along sections of the Lebanon Mountain Trail provide stunning elevation changes and panoramic views.
