These impressive limestone formations have weathered centuries of waves, wind, and shifting coastlines, creating a breathtaking silhouette at the edge of the Raouché district. Beyond their geological intrigue, the rocks hold a powerful place in Lebanese cultural memory. Local legend speaks of a monstrous sea creature defeated by a heroic figure, its fall splitting the rock into the twin arches seen today—a symbol of resilience and victory. Other stories connect the site to ancient Phoenician rituals, maritime tales, and the deep spiritual bond between the Lebanese people and the sea. Throughout modern history, Raouché has remained a gathering place for poets, fishermen, families, and travelers, each drawn to its dramatic cliffs and tranquil horizon.

Today, the promenade is lined with stylish restaurants, chic cafés, and boutiques that reflect Beirut’s unique mix of Mediterranean charm and urban sophistication. Visitors can enjoy peaceful strolls along the wooden boardwalk, where yachts gently sway in the harbor and the salty breeze carries the scent of the sea.

The scents, colors, and sounds of the souks once defined daily life, making them a crossroads of culture and commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although much of the district was devastated during the Lebanese Civil War, its spirit was rekindled through an extensive reconstruction project led by Solidere, which sought to revive the souks while preserving the deep historical layers beneath them. Today, the Beirut Souks stretch across open-air promenades filled with international luxury brands, innovative Lebanese designers, stylish cafés, cinemas, and spacious plazas that host concerts, art exhibitions, seasonal festivals, and community events. Yet beneath the polished walkways lie archaeological remains, ancient street grids, and traces of long-lost marketplaces—quietly telling the story of millennia of trade and cultural exchange.

The Lebanese Civil War, however, left much of this treasured district shattered, its streets emptied and its landmarks reduced to ruins. Yet in the 1990s, a massive reconstruction effort led by Solidere sparked an extraordinary transformation, meticulously restoring historical facades while introducing modern infrastructure, refined urban planning, and contemporary architecture. Today, Downtown Beirut stands as a testament to the city’s resilience and capacity for renewal. Its elegant boulevards are lined with luxury boutiques, stylish cafés, art galleries, cultural institutions, and renovated heritage buildings that reflect the city’s cosmopolitan character.

Its dedicated staff undertook extraordinary measures to safeguard its priceless artifacts, encasing statues in concrete, burying mosaics under protective layers, and sealing delicate pieces in sandbags to shield them from shelling and looting. Thanks to their heroic efforts, much of the collection emerged intact, allowing future generations to experience the depth of Lebanon’s past. Today, the fully restored museum is a jewel of national heritage, with beautifully curated galleries that guide visitors through thousands of years of history—from prehistoric settlements and Phoenician maritime culture to the grandeur of the Roman and Byzantine eras and the artistic richness of the Islamic period. Among its most iconic pieces are the Phoenician anthropoid sarcophagi, mesmerizing Roman frescoes, intricate gold jewelry, and monumental limestone statues. Thoughtfully designed multimedia displays and warm, atmospheric lighting bring these ancient civilizations to life, creating a powerful connection between past and present.

These majestic trees—Cedrus libani, the pride of Lebanon—have been revered for thousands of years, celebrated in mythology, sacred texts, and the artistry of ancient civilizations. Their exceptional durability, aromatic wood, and resistance to decay made them one of the most sought-after materials of the ancient world. The Phoenicians built their legendary ships from cedar beams; the Egyptians used the wood for sarcophagi and ceremonial boats; and the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians coveted it for palaces, fortresses, and monumental temples. The Bible itself recounts that cedar wood was used to construct the famed Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, further elevating the tree’s spiritual and cultural significance. Yet the cedar’s importance extends far beyond commerce and empire. For millennia, it has symbolized strength, eternity, and divine protection—a living emblem woven into Lebanon’s identity and even honored on its national flag. Today, protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Cedars of God form a serene sanctuary where ancient giants tower over winding mountain paths, their silhouettes etched against the crisp alpine sky. Walking among these millennia-old trees, visitors feel a profound sense of continuity, as if stepping into a timeless landscape that has silently witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations.

One of its most remarkable features is the famed Phoenician sea wall—an extraordinary feat of ancient engineering crafted to shield the harbor from powerful waves. Remarkably, sections of this wall still stand today, silently testifying to the ingenuity of the civilization that built it. Over the centuries, Batroun evolved under the influence of Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, and Ottomans, each leaving behind layers of architecture, fortifications, churches, and charming alleyways that give the town its unique atmosphere. Yet Batroun is far from being just a historical treasure. It has blossomed into a vibrant cultural hub known for its artisanal lemonade, lively nightlife, boutique guesthouses, and beautiful stone homes draped in bougainvillea.

It was from Byblos that the Phoenician alphabet—one of humanity’s greatest innovations and the ancestor of most modern writing systems—began its spread across the world, influencing Greek, Latin, and countless scripts that followed. As a bustling maritime hub, Byblos forged vital connections between Egypt, Mesopotamia, Cyprus, and the Aegean, thriving on trade in prized commodities such as papyrus, Lebanese cedar wood, and the rare purple dye coveted by ancient royalty.Across millennia, the city witnessed the rise and fall of powerful empires—Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Crusader, and Ottoman—each leaving behind architectural marvels and cultural traces that form the city’s unique archaeological tapestry. Today, visitors can explore these layered remnants of history firsthand: from Neolithic dwellings and Phoenician temples to Roman colonnades, Byzantine basilicas, medieval ramparts, and the imposing Crusader castle that overlooks the sea.

Its name, meaning “House of Faith,” echoes the pride and significance the complex held for the Shihab dynasty and the surrounding communities.

Today, its archaeological landscapes reveal layer upon layer of this extraordinary past. The Al-Bass Archaeological Site, located inland, is perhaps the most impressive: a sprawling complex that includes a vast Roman necropolis filled with intricately carved sarcophagi, a monumental triumphal arch marking the entrance to the ancient city, and one of the world’s largest and best-preserved hippodromes, where chariots once thundered along its elongated racetrack. Closer to the coast lies the Al-Mina site, a waterfront district where visitors can wander through remnants of colonnaded streets, grand bathhouses, residential quarters, and mosaic pavements that reflect the refined urban life of Roman Tyre.Together, these ruins paint a vivid portrait of a city that not only commanded the seas but helped shape the cultural and commercial networks of the ancient world.

Built by the Crusaders in the early 13th century on a small rocky island, the fortress was constructed over the remains of a much older Phoenician temple, symbolizing Sidon’s continuous layers of history. Its strategic position allowed it to protect the bustling port, control trade routes, and withstand repeated assaults from rival powers. A narrow stone causeway, rebuilt during the Mamluk period, links the castle to the mainland and leads visitors toward its imposing walls, rugged towers, and arched gateways shaped by centuries of wind and waves. Inside, the castle reveals a labyrinth of vaulted chambers, stairways, and lookout points that once served as military quarters and defensive platforms. The upper terrace offers sweeping views of Sidon’s old souks, the modern cityscape, and the shimmering Mediterranean stretching endlessly beyond. Over time, the structure has been modified by both Mamluks and Ottomans, blending Crusader solidity with Islamic architectural refinements. Today, Sidon Sea Castle stands not only as an archaeological gem but as a vivid window into the city’s dynamic past—a place where ancient Phoenicians, medieval knights, merchants, and sailors all left their mark.

The scale of the complex is staggering: the six remaining columns of the Temple of Jupiter rise nearly 23 meters high, among the tallest ever constructed by the Romans, and are supported by enormous stone blocks whose transportation and placement still puzzle engineers today. Nearby, the remarkably preserved Temple of Bacchus captivates visitors with its richly detailed friezes, mythological reliefs, and colossal doorway, offering a rare glimpse into the artistic mastery and religious devotion of the ancient world.Wandering through Baalbek’s vast courtyards, monumental staircases, and sunlit colonnades feels like stepping into a living chronicle of history—each stone echoing the footsteps of priests, emperors, traders, and poets who traveled here centuries ago. Layers of Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic influence intertwine in its architecture, reflecting the site’s long and complex past. Beyond its archaeological splendor, Baalbek has long held a spiritual and cultural significance that transcends time, inspiring travelers, historians, and artists with its grandeur and mystery. Today, it is not only a marvel of ancient engineering but also a symbol of Lebanon’s profound heritage, inviting visitors to experience an unforgettable journey through the mythology, majesty, and enduring spirit of a civilization that once worshipped the sun.','/images/baalbek.jpg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(15,'places','Bekaa','? Anjar','Anjar: The Umayyad City of the Bekaa','Umayyad-era archaeological city featuring symmetrical design.','Located at the crossroads of ancient trade routes in the fertile Bekaa Valley, Anjar is a rare archaeological treasure that encapsulates a brief yet extraordinary chapter in early Islamic history. Founded in the early 8th century by the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I, the city was conceived as a grand palace-complex that would embody the power, refinement, and urban vision of the Umayyad dynasty at its height. Unlike most ancient Lebanese cities that evolved organically over millennia, Anjar was meticulously planned from the ground up. Its grid-like layout—clearly influenced by Roman and Byzantine urban models—is organized around two main colonnaded avenues, the Cardo and the Decumanus, which intersect at a majestic tetrapylon. Within this structured framework lie the remains of palatial residences, ornate baths, defensive walls, mosques, audience halls, and commercial districts, all blending Greco-Roman architectural features with early Islamic design elements.What makes Anjar particularly compelling is its fleeting lifespan: occupied for less than a century, the city was abandoned following the fall of the Umayyads, leaving it frozen in time and remarkably well-preserved. This unusual historical pause allows visitors to witness an early Islamic city in its purest form, unmarred by later expansions or reconstructions. As a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, Anjar stands as a powerful symbol of Lebanon’s multicultural tapestry, revealing the dynamic exchanges between Arab, Byzantine, and Persian worlds. Today, as travelers walk through its sunlit ruins, they experience a vivid glimpse into the sophistication, artistry, and political ambition that shaped the Umayyad civilization and left an indelible mark on the region’s history.','/images/anjar.jpeg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(16,'places','Bekaa','? Ammiq','Ammiq Wetland : Lebanon\'s Treasure','Ammiq Wetland is a pristine natural reserve nestled in the heart of Lebanon.','Tucked within the fertile expanse of the Bekaa Valley, the Ammiq Wetland is the largest surviving freshwater wetland in Lebanon and one of the most precious ecological sanctuaries in the Middle East. Once part of a vast marsh system that stretched across the valley, Ammiq has endured centuries of agricultural pressure, drainage attempts, and urban expansion, surviving largely thanks to determined conservation efforts and the remarkable resilience of its natural ecosystems. For thousands of years, the wetland has served as a critical stopover for migratory birds traveling between Europe, Asia, and Africa, earning it international recognition as a haven for ornithologists, researchers, and nature enthusiasts. During peak migration seasons, the skies fill with pelicans, storks, herons, eagles, and hundreds of other species, creating one of the most spectacular wildlife displays in the country.But Ammiq’s richness extends far beyond birdlife. Its mosaic of reed beds, freshwater pools, meadows, and winding streams shelters rare amphibians, colorful dragonflies, and elusive mammals such as the European otter, the wild boar, and even the endangered jungle cat. The surrounding landscape reflects centuries of rural tradition, where ancient agricultural techniques, grazing practices, and modern sustainability efforts coexist in harmony. Rustic footpaths invite visitors to explore the area on foot or by bicycle, offering peaceful encounters with Lebanon’s natural heritage far from the noise of the city. Today, the Ammiq Wetland stands not only as a biodiversity hotspot but also as a powerful symbol of environmental preservation in Lebanon—a serene refuge where travelers can reconnect with nature, witness the rhythms of wildlife, and appreciate the fragile beauty of one of the region’s last great wetlands.','/images/ammiq.jpeg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(17,'places','Bekaa','?

Framed by lush trees, charming stone bridges, and the famous Berdawni Boulevard, the river has shaped the rhythm of daily life in Zahlé for centuries. Along its idyllic banks stretch the city’s renowned open-air restaurants, cafés, and pastry shops, where the sound of flowing water mingles with laughter, conversation, and the clinking of glasses filled with local arak. In the early 20th century, this enchanting riverside became a gathering place for Lebanon’s poets, politicians, and artists, earning Zahlé poetic titles such as the “Bride of the Bekaa” and the “City of Wine and Poetry.”Fed by cool mountain springs, the Berdawni’s crystal-clear waters weave through the valley, bringing freshness and vitality, especially during the scorching summer months when families and travelers seek refuge beneath the shade of its sycamores and willows. The riverfront’s vibrant atmosphere comes alive with the aroma of mezze, the melody of traditional music, and the warmth of Zahle’s legendary hospitality. Strolling along the promenade, crossing its bridges, or dining just steps from the water offers an experience that feels both timeless and unmistakably Lebanese. Today, the Berdawni remains one of Lebanon’s most beloved leisure destinations — a place where nature, culture, and conviviality come together to celebrate the enduring spirit of Zahlé.','/images/zahle.jpeg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(201,'hotels','Luxury','?
